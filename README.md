## What is STTIG?
Is a Simple Text To Image Generator, it is powerful in some aspects like speed, performance and quality.

## Why would I choose STTIG?
I isn't the most powerful ai but it is very useful, it has a multi pompt mode that allows you to generate infinite amounts of images just from writing them on a text file, it checks every line on the document and automatically generates one by one the wanted prompts.

Just write, in the input.txt file, your desired propmts, one on each line, the run the second option in the code.

## What are the requirements to run STTIG?
As always in my proyects, the only requirement to run the code is having python, no matter what graphics card or processor you have, it is processed in the cloud.

STTIG is based in Craiyon, all the credits goes to Boris Dayma and Pedro Cuenca
